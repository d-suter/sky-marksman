            Welcome to Sky Marksman! In "Sky Marksman", your aim is to shoot ducks that fly across your screen. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:
            <p><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> Click the 'Start Game' button to begin. The game starts with 3 ducks.</p>
            <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Shoot ducks by clicking on them with your mouse.</p>
            <p><strong>Levels:</strong> The game continuously progresses in levels. Every 5 seconds, if you haven't lost, 2 more ducks will be added to the screen.</p>
            <p><strong>Losing the Game:</strong> If any duck reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends. A 'Game Over' message will display the level you reached.</p>
            <p><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> There is no final level; you play to achieve the highest level and score possible. Challenge yourself to see how far you can go!</p>
            Stay sharp, and happy hunting!
